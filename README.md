# Pharmacy_System_gui
I developed a comprehensive DBMS project using NetBeans IDE, Java, and a MySQL database. This project involved creating robust and reliable functionalities for various pharmacy operations, including inventory management, sales, and customer information. I also designed and implemented a user-friendly GUI using Java's Swing library.
